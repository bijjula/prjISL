## üéØ Project Summary

### Vision
Create an inclusive, AI-powered communication platform that enables seamless, real-time bidirectional translation between spoken language and Indian Sign Language (ISL), breaking down barriers between hearing and deaf/hard-of-hearing communities.

### Key Features
- **Four-Quadrant Translation Interface**: Voice recording, text transcription, ISL gloss display, and 3D avatar rendering
- **Bidirectional Communication**: Voice-to-ISL and ISL-to-voice translation
- **Real-time Processing**: WebSocket-based streaming with <2s end-to-end latency
- **User Management**: Registration, authentication, friend management, and conversations
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 Level AA)

### Technology Stack

#### Frontend
- **Framework**: React 18+ with TypeScript
- **UI Library**: Material-UI or Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit
- **Real-time Communication**: WebRTC, WebSockets
- **Build Tool**: Vite

#### Backend
- **Framework**: FastAPI (Python 3.9+)
- **Database**: H2 Database
- **Message Broker**: Apache Kafka/RabbitMQ
- **Authentication**: JWT with refresh tokens
- **Real-time**: WebSocket connections

#### AI/ML Services
- **ASR**: Automatic Speech Recognition for Indian languages
- **SLR**: Sign Language Recognition using computer vision
- **NLP**: Text-to-gloss and gloss-to-text translation
- **TTS**: Text-to-Speech synthesis
- **Animation**: 3D avatar animation engine
